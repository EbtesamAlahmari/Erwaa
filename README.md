Problem Statement
In Saudi Arabia, water is scarce, and traditional farming methods often waste this precious resource. Farmers typically use fixed irrigation schedules that don't account for changing weather, soil moisture, or the specific needs of different crops. This inefficient use of water leads to poor crop yields, higher costs, and further strains the limited water supply, making it harder to sustain agriculture in the region.

Proposed Solution
Irwaa is a straightforward and affordable irrigation management tool designed to help Saudi farmers save water and boost crop production. By using basic weather data and specific crop information, Irwaa generates easy-to-follow irrigation schedules that tell farmers exactly how much water to use and when. This helps ensure crops get the right amount of water at the right time, reducing waste and improving crop health.
